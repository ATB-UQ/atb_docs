You must state whether you are using the ATB for commercial or academic purposes. If you are using the site for commercial purposes, a range of licensing and collaborative arrangements are possible and will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the intended use. Commercial users can restrict access to molecule they submit, share molecule with groups of existing users and gain access to additional functionality depending on the nature of the agreement.

Once you have stated whether you are using the ATB for Commercial or Academic use, other input boxes will appear. An input box with an asterisk denotes required infromation. If you have stated that you will be using the ATB for commercial purposes you must give a detailed description of what you intend to use the ATB for. The decision to give you a commercial account will depend on what you write.
