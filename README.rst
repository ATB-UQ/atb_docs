# ATB Documentation

The [ATB](https://atb.uq.edu.au/) provides classical molecular force fields for novel compounds. Applications include:

- The study of biomolecule:ligand complexes  
- Structure-based drug design  
- Material engineering  
- The refinement of x-ray crystal complexes  

This github hosts the documentation for installing the docker container and running ATB locally.


## Conditions of use
The Automated Topology Builder (ATB) and Repository has been developed and is currently maintained with support from the University of Queensland (UQ), the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF). Access to the ATB is provided free to academic users from publically funded teaching or research institutions. Access for academic use is conditional on: i) any molecule submitted to the ATB being made publically available and ii) the source of any material downloaded from the ATB being appropriately acknowledged in any publications or other forms in which research using this material is disseminated.

Use of the ATB by other parties, or academic users wishing to restrict the access of others to specific molecules, is considered to be commercial in nature. Commercial access is available by licence or collaborative agreement. Parties interested in commercial licencing or other arrangements should contact Prof Alan E. Mark at the address provided at the bottom of the page.
