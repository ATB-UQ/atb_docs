Adding New Users
================

In addition to the provided admin account, new user accounts can be registered if desired.  

Registering a New User
----------------------

This can be done by navigating to the \"Register\" tab of the top navigation menu.  

.. note::
    This tab will only be visible if you are logged out.
    
Select \"Academic\" for your intended use of the ATB from the drop-down menu.

.. note::
    The distinction between academic and commercial users originates from the live ATB server and only functions vestigially on ATB - Containerized Version.  Registering as an academic user is recommended for the sole purpose of streamlining the account creation process.
    
Provide the appropriate information in all of the required fields marked with an asterix and click the \"Register\" button.

Obtaining a Temporary Password
------------------------------

After registering, the account will be automatically created and a password sent to the admin account.  These credentials can be viewed by logging in as the site admin and navigating to the \"Notifications\" tab of the Admin drop-down interface: http://localhost:8080/index.py?tab=notifications

Changing a Temporary Password
-----------------------------

After receiving the temporary password for your new user account from the site admin, navigate to the \"Login\" tab of the top navigation menu and enter the credentials in the fields provided.  

.. note::
    Remember to log out first if necessary.  

After logging in, the password on the new user account can be changed by navigating to the \"Manage\" tab of the drop-down interface labelled with your username and then clicking \"Change Password\".
