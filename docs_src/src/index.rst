Documentation for installing, running and updating the ATB docker container.

The ATB provides classical molecular force fields for novel compounds. Applications include:

- The study of biomolecule:ligand complexes
- Structure-based drug design
- Material engineering
- The refinement of x-ray crystal complexes

-------------------
This site provides:
-------------------

- Access to classical force fields in formats compatible with GROMACS, GROMOS and LAMMPS simulation packages and CNS,
Phenix, CCP4, Refmac5 and CYANA X-ray and NMR refinement packages.

- A GROMOS to AMBER topology file converter.
- Optimised geometries for molecules within the repository.
