Using the ATB
=============

ATB - Containerized Version should now be ready for use.

Access the web interface for the server from: http://localhost:8080/

Navigate to the login page and enter your organization-specific administrator username (in the email address field) and password.

All email communications on the live ATB server (e.g. user registration emails) are visible from the ``Notifications`` tab: http://localhost:8080/index.py?tab=notifications
