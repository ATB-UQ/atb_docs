Overview of the ATB
===================

The ATB provides classical molecular force fields for novel compounds. Applications include:

    * The study of biomolecule:ligand complexes
    * Structure-based drug design
    * Material engineering
    * The refinement of x-ray crystal complexes

The ATB provides a number of outputs:

    * Access to classical force fields in formats compatible with GROMACS, GROMOS and LAMMPS simulation packages and CNS, Phenix, CCP4, Refmac5 and CYANA X-ray and NMR refinement packages.
    * A GROMOS to AMBER topology file converter.
    * Optimised geometries for molecules within the repository.

This documentation covers the process of using the ATB website to obtain these outputs.
