Downloading Outputs
================================

Files necessary for running molecular dynamics simulations like PDB and ITP files, X-ray docking files like CIF and PQR fils, NMR refinement files are available for both viewing and download. The NMR refinement files are only available for molecules that have been labeled as amino acids by the ATB team. 

.. note::
   All the files on the molecule page are created using tools developed by the ATB team or  other groups. 
  

To retrieve these files simply click on the appropriately labeled tab on the molecule page's navigation bar, and then click on the hyper link. A new page containing the contents of the file will be loaded. The next step will depend on the web browser you are using. 

Firefox and Safari
------------------

If you are using Firefox or Safari then this information cannot be dowloaded. You must instead create a text file with an appropriate name and the correct file extension. Then simply copy and paste the contents of the web page into the aforementioned open file. 

This method will work with all web browsers.

Google Chrome
-------------

If you are using Google Chrome click the kebab menu to right of the URL bar. Navigate to \"More Tools"\  and the click on \"Save Page As"\ . Rename the file with the desired file name and the appropriate file extension. Save it to the desired file location.
