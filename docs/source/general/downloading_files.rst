================================

The information page of a molecule contains
*Files necessary for running molecular dynamics simulations: MTB, G96, PDB, ITP, or moltemplate files depending on the selected format (GROMACS, GROMOS11, GROMOS96, and LAMMPS). The LAMMPS formate is experimental. 
*X-ray docking files: eLBOW CIF, CCD compatible CIF, PDB, CNS (parameter and topology), PQR, and CYANA files
* NMR refinement files: CYANA, CNS (parameter and toplogy), and PDB files. These files are only available for molecules that have been labeled as amino acids by the ATB team. 

.. note::
   All the files on the molecule page are created using tools developed by the ATB team or other groups. 
  
To retrieve these files simply click on the appropriately labeled tab on the molecule page's navigation bar.

For example, if you wish to download the PDB or ITP files for your molecule to run a simulation, you can click on the ‘Molecular Dynamics (MD) Files’ tab.  You can select the format in which the MD files will be downloaded. You can select between GROMACS, GROMOS11, GROMOS96, and LAMMPS.
