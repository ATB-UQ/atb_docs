Submitting New Molecules
========================

If the desired molecule has not yet been entered into the database, then it can be submitted for processing. 

Submission process
------------------

Submitting a new molecule can be done by navigating to the \"Submit"\  tab at the top of the navigation menu

Once open, you must supply the net charge of the molecule and the molecule coordinate data

The coordinate data can be provided in 4 ways

.. note::
   ALL the HYDROGEN atoms must be included when providing coordinate data.

* Drawing/Modifying a molecule with JSME and JSmol. If using this method, go to the \"Using JSME and JSmol"\  section of this page
* Providing a SMILES string. If using this method, go to the \"Using SMILES"\  section of this page
* Uploading a PDB coordinate file
* Pasting the contents of the PDB file into the designated input box.

Once you input the necessary information, click the next button. If the coordinate data matches that of a molecule within the database you will be informed. If the molecule is in the database you can use those topology files. If you would like to submit your version of the molecule, refer to the FAQ.

If the molecule is not within the ATB database click \"Submit this Molecule"\ . 

You will be sent an email once the topology of the molecule has finished being calculated. You will be able to view your submitted molecule by clicking on your profile name in the navigation menu and then selecting submitted molecules. If you click on the Molid of you molecule you will be able to view its information. 

Using JSME and JSmol
--------------------

If you decide to use JSME and JSmol to submit the molecule, click the \"Draw/Modify with JSME and JSmol"\  button. A new window will open.

If you decide to modify a pre-existing molecule you can import a molecule into JSME by either uploading PDB coordinate file or inputing information into the search bar. This information can be either the chemical formula of the molecule, the name of the molecule, or the ID of the molecule in the ATB database. When you click the load button, a line structure will appear in the JSME molecular editor. 

You can also use the JSME molecular editor to simply draw the line structure of the desired molecule. 

Once the desired line structure has been drawn, click \"Translate 2D structure/SMILES to 3D structure"\ . You will be able to view your molecule in 3D using JSmol. If you are happy with your molecule, click \"Transfer to submit page"\ . You will be returned to the molecule submission page with the PDB coordinates pasted in the designated input box. 

Using SMILES
------------

If you decide to use SMILES to submit the molecule, click the \"Provide SMILES"\  button. A new window will open. Input the SMILES string in the input box on the right side of the screen. 

.. note::
   Positive charges in the SMILES string must be assigned to an atom group via []. e.g., cc[c+]

Click \"Translate 2D structure/SMILES to 3D structure"\ . You will able to view your molecule in 3D using JSmol. If you are happy with your molecule, click \"Transfer to submit page"\ . You will be returned to the molecule submission page with the PDB coordinates pasted in the designated input box.
